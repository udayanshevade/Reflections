Q1_ When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A_ You would create a remote repository when you want to save your files externally and/or open your project to collaboration.

Q2_ Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A_ For the same reason as committing manually, changes that are incomplete might get updated. Things you don't want shared yet might become open to the public.

Q3_ Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A_ A branch is a unique avenue of commits. A clone is a branch that is copied from one source to another. And lastly, a fork is a built-in type of clone hosted on GitHub, which provides a way of preserving the original source and lessens the work required.

Q4_ What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
A_ Having a copy locally allows us to have an offline version which we can then compare later to a changed remote. It may also act as a backup to ensure changes are recorded and an independent history is stored.
